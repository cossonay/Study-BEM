A python script to automate the imports and naming according to pure [BEM notation](https://getbem.com/)

---

The script can be used both as a console and as a module.

Also there is a [branch](https://github.com/sorrtory/Study-BEM/tree/submodule) that can be easily added as a submodule (example in Study-Practicum Mesto frontend)

## Project idea

Block Element Modifier methodology is always about following the same steps:

1. Create a folder
2. Create a file
3. Create a css class
4. Create an import line
5. Well, finally writing css

It is slow and repetitive work with no chances to rename or delete something properly.

### IDE plugins

I did not find any plugins for these exact actions.
Apart from that, addons could easily act different in other IDEs.
So, that is the reason I suggest using a script file for these.

## Quick overview

The program contains classes of Block, Element and Modifier.
They could be used for programming a file structure (and css could be injected too)

### Example. Block creation

```python
from pathlib import Path
from BEM import BEM, Block, Element, Modifier # BEM.py is beside
# Script supposed be placed one level lower than the root folder
root = Path(__file__).parent.parent           # Project folder 
blocks = root.joinpath("src", "blocks")       # Blocks folder
css = root.joinpath("src", "index.css")       # CSS file where you use imports
b = BEM(root, blocks, css)                    # Init the file paths
block = Block(b, "my_programmed_block")       # initialize a block 
block.create()                                # Create it
```

This will produce a new folder, css file and line inside index.css

### Example. Modifier with values example

Modifiers can be bool and valued. The valued instances should have a list of values

```python
mod = Modifier(b, block, "place", ["bot", "mid", "top"])
mod.values_css["bot"] = "raw_css"   # Add css only to "bot"
                                    # Others are default
mod.create()
```

## Functionality

### Objects methods

| Method                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `create`                 | Create an object. Raise an error if it is not possible. |
| `remove`                 | Remove an object. Raise an error if it is not possible. |
| `rename`                 | Rename an object. Raise an error if it is not possible. |
| `parse_descendants` (`parse_values` in modifiers)      | Find the descendant object and save them to lists (`obj.elements`, `obj.modifiers`, `obj.values`). |
| `get_css` (`get_css_with_values` in modifiers)                   | Read CSS file. |
| `obj.css = ""`             | Change the value of CSS. |
| `set_css()`                | Write `obj.css` to the file. |
| `update_import_line()`     | Add import if needed. |

> Modifier with value is slightly different and sometimes has own methods.

### BEM instance

Also, there is a controller class, which serves its own methods. It is essential for objects as a path config and used to write and read css import file as well.

BEM instance has interactive console, which allow you to serve objects on the fly:

| Method               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `get_default_bem`  | Use default config. |
| `start_loop`       | Launch the input console. Print some info. |
| `parse`           | Parse all blocks and their descendants. Save them to `bem.blocks`. |
| `get_blocks`      | Return the list of blocks. |
| `get_elements`    | Return the list of elements. |
| `get_modifiers`   | Return block modifiers list and element modifiers list. |
| `fix_imports`     | Add all missing imports. |
| `launch_editor`   | Start a editor with the last created file |
| `make_import_backup` | Create a copy of css import file. |

## Usage
>
> Written with python 3.12

Create src, blocks, index.css.
Launch BEM\.py (change bem default config if needed).
The console serves [previous mentioned](#bem-instance) BEM methods.
At first, choose a method, then define a block / element/ modifier.
Also you can use a ? for some help.

```bash
$ python3 BEM.py 
Parsed blocks:  aboba1 | block1 | element | 
Use ? for hint
> ?
Exit(0) / Create(1) / Remove(2) / Rename(3) / Show(4) / Fix(5) / Parse(6) / Code(7) / Backup(8)
> fix
Updated 17 lines
> 3
- rename > ?
Back(0) / Block(1) / Element(2) / Modifier(3): 
- rename > 1
Set block name: element
Enter new name: el
Renamed
> 

```

## Future functionality

- Add css editing in console
- Existing names autocomplete
- Console oneline commands support

## Summing up

This project was an experiment in automatic file management. I wrote it while working on layouts for Yandex Practicum.

Additionally, there's a major issue with base classes and I can't imagine maintaining it rn ðŸ¤§

That shows that SOLID classes are much easier to work with and python is not an option for this at all. Let's instead all pray for TypeScript's sanity.
